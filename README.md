# logic-breaker :video_game:

Logic-breaker is a game created by [Armin Windlin](https://github.com/ArminWindlin) and [Christopher Germann](https://github.com/CodingIsLove). 
The game was created in a **24 hour hackathon**. There are so many technologies out there, so we decided to try out some
we never worked with before.
P5, Firebase, Tensorflow.js and Javascript of course :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. We discovered that P5 had a lot of super cool libraries for the DOM, games,
speechrecognition aaaaaaand a lot more, check out the links below for more informations. We could setup a database faster than ever with Firebase. 
And it was fun to fool around with the codesnippet from tensorflow.js. 


# How to play :raised_hand:
You can play the game directly on my **[GithubPage](https://arminwindlin.github.io/logic-breaker/)**.
